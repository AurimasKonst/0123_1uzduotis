abaut me

I'm aUI Designer and Frond End Developer from Sydney, Australia

I enjay taking complex problems and turnning them into simple and beutiful interface designs.
I also love the logic and structure of the coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether
it be HTML, CSS or JQuery.

When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'l find me in the gym or on the court shiiting some hoops.
